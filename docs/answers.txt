	git log .gitignore
	
(d) 1. To keep separate encapsulated changes so as not to contaminate master until ready

	2. To allow the ability to roll back changes if they prove problematic

(e)	git status shows the state of the working directory and staging area, git log shows committed snapshots.

(f)	git log --follow Vehicle.h

(g) git log --grep file

(h) (I)		Classes deriving themselves from other classes. Subclasses inherit member data and functions from their superclasses.

	(II)	Using the same interface for different datatypes or functionality
	
	(III)	bundling of data with the methods/functions that operate on it, such as within classes

(i) The main difference between the two workflows is that in the Integration manager workflow the integration manager
	handles all integration/merging and in the Dictator and lieutenants workflow some integration/merging is handled
	by the lieutenant repositories.

(j) The team of 100 developers would better benefit from the "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow because with that many
	people working on a project it would be more efficient and less complicated if the task of handling merges was split between multiple repositories
	instead of one.
